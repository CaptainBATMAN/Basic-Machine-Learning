# Regression
# The term regression is used when you try to find the relationship between variables.
# In Machine Learning, and in statistical modeling, that relationship is used to predict the outcome of future events.

# Linear Regression
# Linear regression uses the relationship between the data-points to draw a straight line through all them.
# This line can be used to predict future values.

# In Machine Learning, predicting the future is very important.

# How Does it Work?
# Python has methods for finding a relationship between data-points and to draw a line of linear regression.
# We will know how to use these methods instead of going through the mathematic formula.

# In the example below, the x-axis represents age, and the y-axis represents speed.
# We have registered the age and speed of 13 cars as they were passing a tollbooth. 
# Let us see if the data we collected could be used in a linear regression:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]
y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]
plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()

# Import scipy and draw the line of Linear Regression

from scipy import stats

slope, intercept, r, p, std_err = stats.linregress(x, y)

def myfunc(x):
  return slope * x + intercept

mymodel = list(map(myfunc, x))

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.plot(x, mymodel)
plt.show()

# Example Explained

# Import the modules you need:
# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# from scipy import stats

# Create the arrays that represents the values of the x and y axis:
# x = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]
# y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]

# Execute a method that returns some important key values of Linear Regression:
# slope, intercept, r, p, std_err = stats.linregress(x, y)

# Create a function that uses the slope and intercept values to return a new value.
# This new value represents where on the y-axis the corresponding x value will be placed:
# def myfunc(x):
#   return slope * x + intercept

# Run each value of the x array through the function. 
# This will result in a new array with new values for the y-axis:
# mymodel = list(map(myfunc, x))

# Draw the original scatter plot:
# plt.scatter(x, y)

# Draw the line of linear regression:
# plt.plot(x, mymodel)

# Display the diagram:
# plt.show()




# R-Squared
# It is important to know how the relationship between the values of the x-axis and the values of the y-axis is,
#  if there are no relationship the linear regression can not be used to predict anything.
# The relationship is measured with a value called the r-squared.
# The r-squared value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means no relationship, and 1 means 100% related.
# Python and the Scipy module will compute this value for you, all you have to do is feed it with the x and y values

from scipy import stats

x = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]
y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]
slope, intercept, r, p, std_err = stats.linregress(x, y)
print(r)


# Note: The result -076 shows that there is a relationship,
#  not perfect, but it indicates that we could use linear regression in future predictions.



# Predict Future Values
# Now we can use the information we have gathered to predict future values.

# Example: Let us try to predict the speed of a 10 years old car
slope, intercept, r, p, std_err = stats.linregress(x, y)
def myfunc(x):
  return slope * x + intercept
speed = myfunc(10)
print(speed)

# Bad Fit?
# Let us create an example where linear regression would not be the best method to predict future values.


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import stats

x = [89,43,36,36,95,10,66,34,38,20,26,29,48,64,6,5,36,66,72,40]
y = [21,46,3,35,67,95,53,72,58,10,26,34,90,33,38,20,56,2,47,15]

slope, intercept, r, p, std_err = stats.linregress(x, y)

def myfunc(x):
  return slope * x + intercept

mymodel = list(map(myfunc, x))

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.plot(x, mymodel)
plt.show()

# And the r-squared value?

x = [89,43,36,36,95,10,66,34,38,20,26,29,48,64,6,5,36,66,72,40]

slope, intercept, r, p, std_err = stats.linregress(x, y)
print(r)

# The result: 0.013 indicates a very bad relationship, and tells us that this data set is not suitable for linear regression.
