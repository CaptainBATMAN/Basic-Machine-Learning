Machine Learning
Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.
Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI).
Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.


Data Set (important input of ML)
In the mind of a computer, a data set is any collection of data.
It can be anything from an array to a complete database.
In Machine Learning it is common to work with very large data sets.


Data Types
To analyze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with.
We can split the data types into three main categories:
Numerical
Categorical
Ordinal

Numerical:
Numerical data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories:
    Discrete Data
        - numbers that are limited to integers. Example: The number of cars passing by.
    Continuous Data
        - numbers that are of infinite value. Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item

Categorical:
    Categorical data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value, or any yes/no values.

Ordinal:    
    Ordinal data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.


By knowing the data type of your data source, you will be able to know what technique to use when analyzing them.
